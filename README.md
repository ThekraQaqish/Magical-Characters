##Observations & Learnings:
I faced some difficulties in connecting different functions together and managing the variables. Sometimes I used unnecessary variables, which made things more complicated. I realized this was mainly because I'm still getting used to JavaScript syntax.

On the bright side, I learned a lot of new things in CSS — how to fully control the layout of elements, how to make the design responsive on mobile devices, and how to use JavaScript conditions to dynamically apply styles.

I also learned how to deploy a project to GitHub Pages, which was a completely new experience for me.



##Time & Expectations:
On the first day, I worked on the project for 14 continuous hours because I genuinely enjoyed it. On the second day, I spent around 2 to 3 more hours fixing things that weren’t working correctly.

I actually expected the project to take more time, especially since I don’t know much JavaScript. However, after studying the instructor’s code, things started to make more sense. I learned to think logically first before writing any code.
